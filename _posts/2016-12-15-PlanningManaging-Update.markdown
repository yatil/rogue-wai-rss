<p>WAI's Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) has updated these three resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/improving">Web Accessibility First Aid: Approaches for Interim Repairs</a> is intended to help with the situation: "I need to make my website accessible and I don't even know where to start!" It provides guidance on addressing short-term accessibility fixes.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/pol">Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility</a> helps you develop  a simple or comprehensive web accessibility policy for an organization.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/impl/">Planning and Managing Web Accessibility</a> helps you integrate accessibility throughout the web production process. It applies to individual projects and at the organizational level.</li>
</ul>
